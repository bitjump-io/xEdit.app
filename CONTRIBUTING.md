# How to contribute

- [Submitting bug reports](#submitting-bug-reports)
- [Contributing code](#contributing-code)

## Submitting bug reports

The preferred way to report bugs is to use the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/bitjump-io/xedit.app/issues). Before
reporting a bug, read these pointers.

### Reporting bugs effectively

- Mention very precisely what went wrong. "X is broken" is not a good bug
  report. What did you expect to happen? What happened instead? Describe the
  exact steps a maintainer has to take to make the problem occur. We can not
  fix something that we can not observe.

## Contributing code

- Make sure you have a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/signup/free)
- Fork [xedit.app](https://github.com/bitjump-io/xedit.app/)
  ([how to fork a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo))
- Make your changes
- Submit a pull request
([how to create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)).
  Don't put more than one feature/fix in a single pull request.

By contributing code to xedit.app you

 - agree to license the contributed code under xedit.app's [MIT
   license](https://codemirror.net/LICENSE).

 - confirm that you have the right to contribute and license the code
   in question. (Either you hold all rights on the code, or the rights
   holder has explicitly granted the right to use it like this,
   through a compatible open source license or through a direct
   agreement with you.)
